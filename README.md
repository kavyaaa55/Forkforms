# 🥄 ForkForms — Form Builder to React Component Generator

**ForkForms** is a developer-first form builder that lets you visually create forms like Google Forms — but instead of collecting responses, it instantly generates a **clean React component** you can embed in your codebase. Build forms faster, and copy or install the component directly into your project using our CLI tool.
